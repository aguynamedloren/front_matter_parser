# FrontMatterParser

FrontMatterParser is a library to parse files or strings with YAML front matters. When working with files, it can automatically detect the syntax of a file from its extension and it supposes that the front matter is marked as that syntax comments.

## Installation

Add this line to your application's Gemfile:

    gem 'front_matter_parser'

or, to get the development version:

    gem 'front_matter_parser', github: 'laMarciana/front_matter_parser'

And then execute:

    $ bundle

Or install it yourself as:

    $ gem install front_matter_parser

## Usage

Front matters must be between two lines with three dashes `---`.

Given a file `example.md`:

    ---
    title: Hello World
    category: Greetings
    ---
    Some actual content

You can parse it:

    parsed = FrontMatterParser.parse_file('example.md')
    parsed.front_matter #=> {'title' => 'Hello World'}
    parsed.content #=> 'Some actual content'

You can apply directly `[]` method to get a front matter value:

    parsed['category'] #=> 'Greetings'

### Syntax autodetection

`FrontMatterParser` detects the syntax of a file by its extension and suppose that the front matter is within that syntax comments delimiters.

Given a file `example.haml`:

    -#
       ---
       title: Hello
       ---
    Content

The `-#` and the indentation enclose the front matter as a comment. `FrontMatterParser` is aware of it and you can simply do:

    title = FrontMatterParser.parse_file('example.haml')['title'] #=> 'Hello'

Following there is a relation of known syntaxes and their known comment delimiters:

<pre>
| Syntax | Single line comment | Start multiline comment | End multiline comment  |
| ------ | ------------------- | ----------------------- | ---------------------- |
| haml   |                     | -#                      | (indentation)          |
| slim   |                     | /                       | (indentation)          |
| liquid |                     | {% comment %}           | {% endcomment %}       |
| md     |                     |                         |                        |
| html   |                     | &lt;!--                    | --&gt;                    |
| coffee | #                   |                         |                        |
| sass   | //                  |                         |                        |
| scss   | //                  |                         |                        |
</pre>

You can provide your own by passing `autodetect: false` and options for single line comment delimiter (`:comment`) or start multiline comment (`:start_comment`) and end multiline comment (`:end_comment`) delimiters. If `:start_comment` is provided but it isn't `:end_comment`, then it is supposed that the multiline comment is ended by indentation.

    FrontMatterParser.parse_file('example.haml', autodetect: false, start_comment: '<!--', end_comment: '-->') # start and end multiline comment delimiters
    FrontMatterParser.parse_file('example.slim', autodetect: false, start_comment: '/!') # multiline comment closed by indentation
    FrontMatterParser.parse_file('example.foo', autodetect: false, comment: '#') # single line comments

### Parsing a string

You can as well parse a string, providing manually its comment delimiters if needed:

    string = File.read('example.slim')
    FrontMatterParser.parse(string, start_comment: '/')

## Release Policy

`front_matter_parser` follows the principles of [semantic versioning](http://semver.org/).

## To Do

* Add more known syntaxes.
* Allow configuration of global front matter delimiters. It would be easy, but I'm not sure if too useful.
* Allow different formats (as JSON). Again, I'm not sure if it would be very useful.

## Other ruby front matter parsers

* [front-matter](https://github.com/zhaocai/front-matter.rb) Can parse YAML front matters with single line comments delimiters. YAML must be correctly indented.
* [ruby_front_matter](https://github.com/F-3r/ruby_front_matter) Can parse JSON front matters and can configure front matter global delimiters, but does not accept comment delimiters.
